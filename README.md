Deploy Multi-Tier Architecture for a WordPress Website and Configure Backup and Restore in Azure

Instruction

**Deploy Multi-Tier Architecture for a WordPress Website and Configure Backup and Restore in Azure**  

**Problem Statement:**  

Organizations frequently deploy WordPress websites as a crucial part of their online presence. Ensuring the proper deployment and data protection of these websites is vital. This project aims to deploy a multi-tier architecture for hosting a WordPress website on Azure, and then configure backup and restore mechanisms to safeguard website data and maintain system availability.  

**Objectives:**  

•    Design and deploy a multi-tier architecture on Azure for hosting a WordPress website. This architecture should include:  
o    Azure Web Servers: To host the WordPress site.  
o    Azure Application Servers: To run PHP and support the WordPress application.  
o    Azure Database Server: To store the website's data (using MySQL or Azure Database for MySQL).  
•    Install and configure WordPress on the web server to create a functional website.  
•    Implement data backup and restore mechanisms for the WordPress database to prevent data loss.  
•    Configure automated backup schedules to ensure regular backups of the WordPress database.  
•    Test the restore process to verify data recovery capabilities in case of an incident.  

**Your focus in this project should be on the following:**  

Before starting the project, ensure you have access to the following services and tools:  
•    Azure Portal: You should have an Azure account for creating resources such as virtual machines, databases, and storage.  

**Deliverables**  

The project deliverables include:  

•    A deployed multi-tier architecture on Azure, including web servers, application servers, and a database server.  
•    A fully functional WordPress website running on the multi-tier architecture.  
•    Implemented data backup and restore mechanisms for the WordPress database.  
•    Automated backup schedules configured to ensure regular data backups.  
•    Successful testing of the restore process to demonstrate data recovery capabilities.  

**Timeline**  
•    10 Hrs  

**Tasks/Activities List**  

**Azure Resource Setup:**  

•    Create an Azure Web Server.  
•    Create an Azure Application Server.  
•    Set up an Azure Database Server (MySQL or Azure Database for MySQL).  

**WordPress Installation and Configuration:**  

•    SSH into the web server.  
•    Install WordPress and configure it to use the Azure Database Server as its backend.  
•    Set up necessary themes and plugins.  

**Data Backup and Restore:**  

•    Implement backup scripts or utilize Azure Backup services for the WordPress database.  
•    Set up automated backup schedules.  
•    Test the backup and restore process.  

**Success Metrics**  

•    Successful deployment of a multi-tier architecture for hosting a WordPress website on Azure.  
•    A fully functional WordPress website accessible via a public URL.  
•    Implementation of effective data backup and restore mechanisms for the WordPress database.  
•    Configuration of automated backup schedules to ensure regular data backups.  
•    Successful testing of the restore process to demonstrate data recovery capabilities.  

**Bonus Points**  

Additional elements to enhance the project's quality:  
•    Implement disaster recovery strategies in addition to backup and restore mechanisms.  

**Submission Process**  

•    Detailed project report outlining the steps and configurations.  
•    Proof of a functioning WordPress website and the IP/URL where it can be accessed.  
•    Proof of successful backup and restore testing to demonstrate data recovery capabilities.g
